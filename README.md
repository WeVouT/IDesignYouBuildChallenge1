# I Design You Build Challenge - 1

I came acorss this project when going through some dev.to posts. ([dev.to Post](https://dev.to/zernonia/i-design-you-build-frontend-challenge-1-158a))
The premise is pretty easy. There is a fully designed page in figma with all assets and design for free.
The task is to build that site in a technology of your own choosing. Since I haven't been using tailwind for too long I wanted to give it a go.
